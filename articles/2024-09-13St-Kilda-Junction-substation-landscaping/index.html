      <h1>St Kilda Junction substation landscaping</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>We’re delivering improved landscaping at the St Kilda Junction substation.</p><p>In 2019 we delivered a new substation at St Kilda Junction to improve services and reliability on tram routes 3/3a, 5, 16, 64 and 67. We’re now planting additional vegetation to enhance visual amenity in the area.</p><h2>We’re addressing this by:</h2><ul><li>Planting additional vegetation closer to the substation fence to make the screening of the substation more dense</li><li>Planting a mixture of species with varying height and span to further screen the substation</li><li>Implementing a detailed maintenance plan with landscaping contractors to oversee the vegetation establishment, as well as ongoing maintenance with the land managers.</li></ul><p>Works will take place from Monday, 16 September for up to two weeks at the substation site on St Kilda Road between Fitzroy and Pattison streets.</p><p>Works will take place between 9:00am and 3:30pm on weekdays and between 9:00am and 5:00pm on weekends to minimise disruptions to the local community.</p><h2>What to expect:</h2><ul><li>Vehicles, machinery, and contractors on site</li><li>Low levels of noise</li><li>One lane of traffic will be closed on each side of the junction (St Kilda Road and Nepean Highway) while works are taking place</li><li>Two unhealthy trees will be removed and replaced with new planting</li><li>Tram services will not be impacted.</li></ul><p>Works are anticipated to cause minimal disruption to the local community and road users.</p><p>Works are dependent on weather and subject to change. We appreciate your patience while we complete these works.</p><p>For more information email us at <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1a6a6e6c6a6875707f796e695a6e687b74696a75686e346c7379347d756c347b6f"><span>[email protected]</span></a> or call 1800 800 007.</p>
