      <h1>La Trobe Street tram stop upgrade</h1>
      <p></p>
      <div></div> <div><p>Making our public transport network accessible to all Victorians is a priority, which is why creating more accessible transport options is a key part of our $100 billion transport infrastructure program.</p><p>La Trobe Street is the last remaining CBD tram corridor without accessible tram stops. With low-floor E Class trams operating on Route 30, a major tram route along La Trobe Street, upgrading the tram stops along this corridor will provide greater accessibility benefits for tram passengers.</p><p>The first stage of construction will take place in July 2024 and the second stage in August 2024.</p></div> <h2>Keep up to date</h2> <div></div>
