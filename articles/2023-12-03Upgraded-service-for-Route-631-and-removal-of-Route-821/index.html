    <p><strong>From 3 December, Route 631 will realign from Old Dandenong Road to Clayton Road which will deliver additional services to where demand is greatest and boost weekday peak frequency.</strong></p><p>Route 631 will be realigned from Old Dandenong Road to Clayton Road.</p><p>The change to route 631 will:</p><ul>
<li>Deliver additional services to where demand is greatest.</li>
<li>Improve frequency of bus services to every 20 minutes (from 30 mins) on weekday peaks, 30 minutes weekday interpeak, 40 minutes on Saturdays and 60 minutes on Sundays.</li>
<li>Have an earlier Sunday start.</li>
</ul><p>All existing school connections (Cheltenham Secondary, John Monash Science and Wellington Secondary College) will be retained.Â </p><p>Route 821 will be removed due to overlap with the more regular Route 631. Passengers can take Route 631 instead.</p><p>Feedback provided during community consultation in early 2023 helped shape these improvements.</p><p>These changes are required to maintain coverage and access for travellers as a result of altered local road access with the introduction of the Suburban Rail Loop. They will also boost weekday peak frequency, give more travel choices and respond to peak demand pressures in areas such as Clayton, Notting Hill and Mulgrave.</p><p><img src="/files/58b76219100dcb22cec416870de9315af1a488ae.jpg" alt="A map of the Heatherton bus route changes" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" /></p><p><a href="/files/58b76219100dcb22cec416870de9315af1a488ae.jpg" target="_blank">View map in a new window</a></p><p>Check your timetables before you travel.</p><p>Timetables and more information are available at <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/home/">ptv.vic.gov.au</a>, <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/about-ptv/digital-tools/mobile-apps/">PTV app</a> or by calling PTV on 1800 800 007.</p>
