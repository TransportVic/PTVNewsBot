      <h1>Gardiners Creek bridge upgrade works</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>From 10pm Friday 21 January to 5am Saturday 29 January, Glenferrie Road, between Toorak Road and Riversdale Road in Kooyong will be closed for essential bridge upgrade and tram track renewal works.</p><h2>About the project</h2><p>The Victorian Government is investing $2.41 million to upgrade the bridge over Gardiners Creek on Glenferrie Road in Kooyong.</p><p>To be able to complete this work safely, we’ll be closing a section of Glenferrie Road between Toorak Road and Riversdale Road from 10pm Friday 21 January to 5am Saturday 29 January 2022.</p><p>As part of this upgrade, we will:</p><ul><li>Demolish the existing pavement, kerb, footpath and tram track slab.</li><li>Replace the existing bridge deck with a cement stabilised decking.</li><li>Construct a new tram track slab and install new tram tracks.</li><li>Reinstate the pavement, kerb and footpath at the completion of works.</li></ul><p>Medium to high level noise can be expected in the first 1-3 days of works while we demolish the existing bridge deck. However, there will be intermittent noise expected after this time.</p><p>Where possible, we’ll look to carry out the noisiest works during the day to minimise the disruption on the local community.</p><p>Traffic management will be on site and detours will be in place to help motorists travel around the works safely. Please plan ahead when moving through the area and allow an extra 15 minutes travel time. </p><p>Access for local residents and businesses will be maintained at all times during construction. Pedestrians and cyclists will also be able to travel through the work zone via the footpath on the west side of the bridge.</p><p>The Gardiners Creek Trail under the bridge will remain open during works with only intermittent closures where pedestrians and cyclists will be required to take a short detour and cross Glenferrie Road at the existing pedestrian crossing. </p><h2>Project background</h2><p>This work is being completed as part of the Securing the Safety and Productivity of Victoria’s Road Network program. </p><p>Bridge strengthening works are being delivered across metropolitan Melbourne as we deliver an integrated, sustainable and safe transport system for all Victorians. </p><p>To ensure the structural integrity of the Glenferrie Road bridge into the future, we’re upgrading the existing bridge deck to a cement stabilised deck and renewing the tram tracks on the bridge. </p><p> <span> <strong><a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PTV-default-site/footer/about-ptv/improvements-and-projects/tram/PTVH5189-STU03251-VR-Glenferrie-Road-Bridge-Strengthening-Works_Map_A4_v7_FA_600px.png" target="_blank">Download the Gardiners Creek bridge upgrade works map</a></strong> <span>(PNG) 285 KB</span> </span></p><h2>Public transport service changes  </h2><h3>Tram impacts</h3><p>Buses will replace trams between Dandenong Road in Malvern and Cotham Road in Kew from the first service Saturday 22 January until the last service on Friday 28 January. Temporary replacement bus stops will be provided at each tram stop, except for stop 66, Kooyong Tennis Centre/Glenferrie Road.</p><p>Trams will resume on route 16 from the first service on Saturday 29 January. </p><p>Tram replacement buses run to normal frequency during works, however there may be some delays due to congestion around the works zone. </p><p>More information about public transport changes during these works will be available shortly.</p><h2>Local businesses</h2><p>While we complete these important bridge strengthening works, it’s business as usual for your local traders. Remember to shop local during works and support local traders. </p><p>Access to businesses will be maintained at all times during construction. </p><h2>Get in touch</h2><p>For more information about this project, please get in touch.</p><p>Email: <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#157866704a78747c7955677a7471663b637c763b727a633b74602a6660777f70766128527467717c7b706766302725566770707e30272577677c71727030272560657267747170302725627a677e66302725"><span>[email protected]</span></a></p>
