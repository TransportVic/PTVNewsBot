      <h1>New bus route for Sunbury and Diggers Rest</h1>
      <p></p>
      
	
    <p>From 24 March, we’re introducing a new bus service across Melbourne’s rapidly growing north-west, improving connections to shops, schools, train stations and other amenities. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/15810/475-sunbury-station-a-diggers-rest-station/">Route 475 Sunbury Station - Diggers Rest Station</a> will improve the local bus network, connecting new estates to the places people want to go, and better support Sunbury and Diggers Rest’s growing communities.</p>

</p>
<p>The new service will operate between the two popular stations seven days a week with a 20 minute frequency throughout most of the daytime on weekdays, and 40 minutes in the evenings and on weekends.</p>
<p>It will address coverage gaps on Elizabeth Drive in Sunbury and on the western side of Diggers Rest, while also linking with trains at Diggers Rest Station to connect Sunbury and Diggers Rest locals to the broader transport network. </p>
<p>Diggers Rest residents will also have better access to Sunbury Downs College which is their zoned secondary school. </p>
<p>To improve efficiency and accommodate for the new Route 475 service at Sunbury Station bus interchange there will be minor timetable changes to routes 481, 483 ,485, and 489, as well as bay allocation changes for routes 479, 481, 483, 486, 487 and 488.</p>
