      <h1>Route and timetable changes for Route 742</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>From Sunday 11 April 2021, bus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802084851/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/14930/742-ringwood-chadstone-sc-via-vermont-south-and-glen-waverley-and-oakleigh/">Route 742 - Ringwood Chadstone Shopping Centre via Vermont South, Glen Waverley and Oakleigh</a> - will be extended to terminate at Ringwood Station and provide a two-way service along Bond Street and New Street in Ringwood. The service will also become more consistent with the removal of an under-utilised route variation along Ferntree Gully Road. The timetable will reflect new journey times and will coordinate with trains at Glen Waverley Station.</p><p><span>A two-way service along Bond Street and New Street in Ringwood will improve public transport access for residents in the growing area and create better access to key destinations including Ringwood Station, Eastland Shopping Centre and Ringwood Square Shopping Centre.</span></p><p><span>Extending the route to Ringwood Station will make for easier access and better connections with rail and bus services at the Ringwood Station Bus Interchange. </span></p><p><span>Route 742 currently has three route alignments around Monash University. Current under-utilised trips that run along Ferntree Gully Road between Blackburn Road and Gardiner Road will be replaced by the main route path along Normanby Way. </span></p><p><span>The changes provide a simpler, more consistent, and reliable timetable for passengers.</span></p><p><span>View the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802084851/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/14930/742-ringwood-chadstone-sc-via-vermont-south-and-glen-waverley-and-oakleigh/">Route 742</a> timetable. </span></p><p><span>To plan your journey, visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802084851/https://ptv.vic.gov.au/journey/">Journey planner</a> or order a printed copy of a timetable by calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210802084851/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/">1800 800 007</a>.</span></p>
