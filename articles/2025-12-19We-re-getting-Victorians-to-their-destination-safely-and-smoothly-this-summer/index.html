      <h1>We're getting Victorians to their destination safely and smoothly this summer</h1>
      <div><p>Maintenance works are also underway and progressing well on Hamilton Highway, Birchip-Sea Lake Road and Wangaratta-Whitfield Road. </p><p>Our crews have been clearing roadside vegetation across the state to help reduce fire risk. We began mowing and slashing in early spring and their first cut is now complete. They’ll be back out in the new year with recent rainfall expected to keep grass growing.</p><p>On top of this, we’ve recently wrapped up works on major projects in some of the state’s tourism hotspots, including multiple upgrades along the <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/news-and-resources/projects/great-ocean-road-bridge-replacement-at-wye-river">Great Ocean Road, bridge upgrades at Wye River</a>, and road repairs at Phillip Island.</p><p>These upgrades will make travelling easier and safer for Victorians and visitors to our state this summer.</p><p>Crews will take a break from 19 December 2025 through until 5 January, 2026 returning ready to deliver major roadworks on some of the state’s busiest and most important roads. These include the Princes Highway, Northern Highway and Western Highway.</p><h2>Stay safe on the road this summer</h2><p>While there may not be workers on site over the holiday season, we’re reminding drivers to stick to signed speed limits when driving through roadworks sites. </p><p>While some of these sites may look like we’ve completed works, there can be hidden dangers, and the reduced speed limits are there to keep you safe.</p></div>
