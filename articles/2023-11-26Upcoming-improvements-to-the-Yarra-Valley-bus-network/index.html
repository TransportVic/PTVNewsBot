    <p>From 26 November 2023, changes to the Yarra Valley bus network for routes 684, 685, 686 and 687 will be introduced.</p><p>The changes will see four routes streamlined into two, extra services added to the busiest section of the network, improved frequencies on weekends, better connections between buses and trains and simplified timetables, making it easier for passengers to get to where they need to go. Community feedback has helped shape these changes that are designed to streamline the network, expand customer travel choices, and improve productivity and patronage on the network.</p><h2>Summary of changes to the Yarra Valley bus network</h2><p>From 26 November, the following changes will be introduced to the bus network:</p><ul>
<li>Route 684 (<em>Eildon via Healesville to Melbourne</em>) will stop at Ringwood Station. Passengers traveling to the CBD can choose to transfer to train services at Lilydale or Ringwood stations.</li>
<li>Route 685 (<em>Healesville to Lilydale</em>) coverage will extend to Badgers Creek and Healesville Sanctuary and provide more frequent services, a better span of hours and a more consistent timetable.</li>
<li>Route 686 (<em>Healesville – Badger Creek</em>) will be replaced by the extended Route 685 which will provide a consistent service to the Badger Creek area.</li>
<li>Route 687 (<em>Healesville to Chum Creek</em>) will be discontinued due to low patronage.</li>
<li>Savings from consolidating routes 685 and 686 will be reinvested into Route 685’s improvements.</li>
<li>School special services will be improved. Details of upcoming changes to school services will be communicated directly to local schools.</li>
</ul>
