    <p>The Victorian Government is modernising Victoria’s public transport network, with a new ticketing contract now signed to improve the myki system, giving passengers more options when they travel across the state.</p><p>Minister for Public Transport Ben Carroll today announced globally renowned ticketing supplier Conduent Business Services will be the next operator of the state’s public transport ticketing system, under a new 15-year contract.</p><p>The new contract will make sure the myki system is more efficient and effective over the coming years, and will see the system evolve with modern improvements using proven technologies in the market so all transport users can safely and seamlessly access, use and pay for public transport.</p><p>Following trials commencing in 2024, improvements will be progressively added to the existing payment options and will allow passengers to tap on and off with their credit or debit card and pay with a digital wallet on a smartphone or smart watch.</p><p>There will not be any immediate changes to the current myki or V/Line ticketing system as Conduent transitions into the ticketing system, with customers still able to purchase and top-up myki at train stations, retail agents, as well as through online services and over the phone as they always have done.</p><p>New features will be added progressively to make sure Victorians can easily transition to new, more convenient ways of buying a ticket to travel.</p><p>Conduent Business Services has delivered and operates more than four hundred ticketing systems across 24 countries including in Paris, Dubai, Montreal and New Jersey.</p><p>The Victorian Government has made significant improvements to the myki system over the past seven years under the current contract, making it simpler and easier to use with the introduction of mobile myki on Android devices, instant top ups in PTV app including with Apple Pay and the installation of hundreds of next-generation myki readers.</p><p>Passengers have saved millions of dollars on public transport fares since the Government’s regional fare cap came into effect on March 31, transforming the way people travel across the state.</p><p>The new ticketing contract will begin on 1 December 2023.</p>
