    <p>The Department of Transport and Planning is making improvements to Route 538.</p><h3>What are the changes?</h3><ul>
<li>From 17 December, passengers on Route 538 will travel direct along Camp Road, making for a more reliable and faster journey. This change provides a more direct journey for Somerset Estate residents to Broadmeadows.</li>
<li>Route 538 <em>Somerset Estate â€“ Broadmeadows via Camp Road </em>will no longer travel via Holberry, Walsh, Graham and Widford streets.</li>
<li>Route 538 will continue to run every 40 minutes on weekdays and weekends.</li>
<li>On Saturdays, passengers will benefit with six additional afternoon trips in each direction providing greater flexibility when to travel.</li>
<li>Residents surrounding Holberry, Walsh, Graham and Widford can access Route 538 or SmartBus 902 from Camp Road.</li>
</ul><p>Passengers should check the timetable before they travel.</p><p>New timetables will be available at <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/home/">ptv.vic.gov.au</a>, <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/about-ptv/digital-tools/mobile-apps/" target="_blank">PTV app</a> or by calling PTV on 1800 800 007 from Friday 24 November.</p><p><img src="/files/e23247ff93103edd4bb327bec359e538c9950458.jpg" alt="A map of the changed route for Bus Route 538" width="2000" height="1481" loading="lazy" /></p><p><a href="/files/e23247ff93103edd4bb327bec359e538c9950458.jpg" target="_blank">Open map in a new window</a></p>
