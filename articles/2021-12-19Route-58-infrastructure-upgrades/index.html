      <p></p><p><span>We’re upgrading Melbourne’s tram network to deliver accessible </span><span>transport and meet Melbourne’s future transport needs.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Route 58 has been selected as the next route for E-Class trams as it serves key employment areas including the Parkville medical precinct, CBD, South Yarra and population growth areas.</span></p><h4><span>What's happening?</span></h4><p><span>E-class trams will operate on Route 58 from Sunday 19 December 2021. From this date, some stops along the route will no longer be in service</span></p><p>Visit the <a href="https://transport.mysocialpinpoint.com/route-58-upgrade-map#/" target="_blank">Route 58 upgrade map</a> to find out about works happening at your nearest stop, including stop removals.</p><h4><span>What do the works involve?</span></h4><p><span>We've made changes to Route 58  so that E-Class trams can operate safely and efficiently.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>These changes are essential to support the safe roll-out of E-Class trams, our biggest and most accessible trams in Melbourne.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span>E-Class trams are significantly longer than the trams currently operating on Route 58. To ensure that they can be accessed safely some stops will need to be removed, </span><span>relocated</span><span> or lengthened and in some cases, this will require carparks to be removed near stops. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>Changes include: </span><span> </span></p><ul><li><span>removing some stops to improve safety </span></li><li><span>lengthening stops so they are safe for E-Class trams to use</span><span> </span></li><li><span>changing or replacing road markings</span><span> </span><span>and street signs where the stops are longer</span></li><li><span>installing safety upgrades at stops for E-Class trams</span></li></ul><p><span>We’re also addressing operational and safety issues by constructing new substations through the Traction Power Infrastructure Program.</span></p><h4><span>How will this work benefit </span><span>public transport users</span><span>?</span><span> </span></h4><p><span>We expect that future Melbourne will have more people using trams than ever before. Upgrading our network’s infrastructure is essential to ensuring we provide an accessible service to all passengers, meeting future needs and preventing overcrowding.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span>For more information on the project email </span><a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebebab8bebca1a4abadbabd8ebabcafa0bdbea1bcbae0b8a7ade0a9a1b8e0afbb"><span><span>[email protected]</span></span></a> or contact our call centre on <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/">1800 800 007</a>.</p> <div><a href="/files/2483603496b26e5a731896f0301a34fed06d14c1.jpg"></a><p>Route 58 upgrades, removals and nearest stops</p></div>
