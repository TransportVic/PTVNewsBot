    <p>From Sunday 23 October 2022, additional weekend services will be added to the Lancefield – Sunbury, Lancefield – Gisborne and Lancefield – Kyneton routes. Sunday services will be introduced on the Lancefield – Sunbury route for the first time and the Clarkfield Station stop will be replaced by a stop at Sunbury Station on weekend services only, allowing for better travel connections.</p><h3>What’s changing on the Lancefield – Sunbury service?</h3><p>One additional Friday night service and four return Saturday services will be added to the Lancefield – Sunbury timetable.</p><p>On Sundays, five return services will run for the first time.</p><p>The additional services towards Sunbury will allow a faster connection to Melbourne bound trains at Sunbury station until 2pm.</p><p>The additional services towards Lancefield will be timetabled to allow a faster connection with trains arriving at Sunbury from Melbourne after 2pm.</p><p>The Clarkefield Station stop will be removed from the Lancefield – Sunbury route on weekends only. This is due to Sunbury Station providing a better connection and more travel options than Clarkfield station. Currently on Saturdays, services towards Sunbury stop at Clarkefield Station only, this means a return trip from Melbourne via Clarkefield Station is not an option.</p><p>No additional changes will be made to the current service span and route path.</p><h3>What’s changing on the Lancefield – Gisborne and Lancefield – Kyneton services?</h3><p>Two return Sunday services will be added to both bus services. These services will have an identical timetable to the current Saturday timetable.</p><p>There will be no changes to the Monday to Saturday timetable or route paths.</p><p>To plan your journey, view the new timetable for <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/13625/lancefield-sunbury-clarkefield-via-romsey-and-monegeeta/#RoutePage:::datetime=2022-10-22T22%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;direction_id=105&amp;stop_id=-1&amp;_auth=5927f957c23a2b8b82366ff8777f412c4767e25d44a086989b73a5cdea06dff5"><em>Lancefield - Sunbury</em></a>, <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/13631/lancefield-gisborne-via-romsey-and-monegeeta-and-riddells-creek/#RoutePage:::datetime=2022-10-22T22%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;direction_id=483&amp;stop_id=-1&amp;_auth=552fd1da872b7b61e1b21cbc77bd1f25b78a17e80ad91bda24dc25f802af46c1"><em>Lancefield – Gisborne</em></a>, <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/13632/lancefield-kyneton-via-newham-and-carlsuhe/#RoutePage:::datetime=2022-10-22T22%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;direction_id=462&amp;stop_id=-1&amp;_auth=66fb4f5d6e3621edd365075aa533a5869c3415f8f906b3c842147edf78668f55"><em>Lancefield – Kyneton</em></a> bus services, visit <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/plan/">Journey planner</a> or call <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/">1800 800 007</a> to order a printed copy of your timetable.</p>
