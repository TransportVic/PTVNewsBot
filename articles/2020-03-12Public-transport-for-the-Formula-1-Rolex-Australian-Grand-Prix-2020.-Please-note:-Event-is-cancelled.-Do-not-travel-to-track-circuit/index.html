    <p>Following this morning’s announcement that the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled, we are working to help people get home from the event.</p><p>The extra trams already in place will be utilised to return those already at the track.</p><p>To help manage the crowds, we ask those who are heading toward the track to avoid doing so.</p><p>The Department of Transport is working with Victoria Police to ensure safety is prioritised.</p><p>We ask everyone at the track to be patient, listen to announcements and follow the advice of extra staff who are on site. It may take some time to clear the crowds.</p><p>Please note: trams are operating to their normally scheduled timetable.</p>
