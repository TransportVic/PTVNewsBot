The PTV website is now part of the Transport Victoria website, creating a single place for transport information, bringing together public transport, roads and active transport.  </p><p>You will now find real-time information, journey planning tools and myki services conveniently located on the Transport Victoria website.</p><p>The website will continue to evolve over time, with new features to enhance the transport experience.</p><h2>What you need to know</h2><figure><table><colgroup><col></col><col></col></colgroup><tbody><tr><th>Public transport and <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/journey">Journey Planner</a></th><td><p>There are no changes to how you travel.</p><p>The <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/journey">Journey Planner</a> has moved to Transport Victoria, but it will continue to work in the same way you’re used to.  </p></td></tr><tr><th><a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/plan-a-journey/public-transport-tools-and-resources/travel-tips-and-resources/mobile-apps-for-public-transport">PTV App</a></th><td><p>The <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/plan-a-journey/public-transport-tools-and-resources/travel-tips-and-resources/mobile-apps-for-public-transport">PTV App</a> is getting a fresh new look! We’re updating the design to visually align with the Transport Victoria website.  </p><p>We’ve also introduced a few customer experience enhancements, including making it easier to receive notifications, and better visibility of when journeys are impacted by bus replacement services. </p></td></tr><tr><th><a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/tickets-and-myki/myki">myki</a></th><td><p>Your myki will continue working as normal.</p><p>You can still <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/manage-myki">log in to myki</a> using the same username and password on the Transport Victoria website.  </p><p>View our help article on <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/help-and-support/public-transport-ticketing-help/find-your-myki-password">using password manager to find your myki login</a>. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Why we have made this change</h2><p>We’ve listened to customer feedback asking for a simpler, more seamless experience with transport information. The Transport Victoria  website brings together information on public transport, roads, and active transport in one central place.  </p><p>In addition, the old PTV website was nearing the end of its life and would have required further reinvestment to maintain. By bringing public transport information under transport.vic.gov.au, we’re reducing duplication and making it easier for you to travel around our great State.</p><h2>Visit VicRoads for registration and licensing services</h2><p>Visit <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/">VicRoads</a> to complete registration and licensing tasks such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/licences/renew-replace-or-update" target="_blank">renewing a driver’s licence</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/licences/your-ps/how-to-get-your-ps" target="_blank">getting your probationary driver licence</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/renew-update-or-cancel" target="_blank">managing vehicle registration</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/buy-sell-or-transfer-a-vehicle" target="_blank">transferring, buying or selling a vehicle or vessel</a>.</li></ul><h2>myki help</h2></div>
