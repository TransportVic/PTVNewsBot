      <h1>More tarnsport connections to Melbourne Airport</h1>
      <p>Corporate &gt; Bus operator</p>
      <p>From 31 August 2025, the new Eastern Express service will provide Melbourne’s fast-growing eastern suburbs like Box Hill, Doncaster and Watsonia with direct and easy access to Melbourne Airport, with regular departures seven days a week.</p><p>From 9 November 2025, the Sunshine Express service will connect residents and airport workers in the city’s west with Melbourne Airport via Sunshine station. The Sunshine Express timetable is yet to be determined but is expected to run approximately every 30 minutes during operating hours.</p><p>The new SkyBus Sunshine Express improves airport access for regional Victorians, with direct V/Line connections at Sunshine for the Ballarat, Ararat, Warrnambool and Geelong lines.</p><p>Once the new Metro Tunnel opens, the Sunshine Express service will connect with trains from Sunshine to the city via the new Metro Tunnel. Passengers on the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines will have the option to travel directly via the Metro Tunnel to access a SkyBus service from Sunshine rather than going through Southern Cross.</p><p>The new express services will complement SkyBus’ existing Melbourne City Express service connecting travellers with Southern Cross Station in the city and the Peninsula Express service providing connections to south-east bayside suburbs. SkyBus also operates an Avalon City Express service to Melbourne’s second biggest airport.</p><p>More information: <a href="https://www.skybus.com.au/" target="_blank">SkyBus - Express airport transfers</a></p>
