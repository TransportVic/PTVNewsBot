    <p><span>From Sunday 14 November 2021, Route 788 Frankston to Portsea will run more frequently, giving Mornington Peninsula residents and tourists more options on when to travel. </span></p><p><span>The upgraded Route 788 will run every 30 minutes on weekdays. On weekends, services will run every 40 minutes most of the day and every 60 minutes at night. </span></p><p><span>Every second Route 788 service will run from Frankston to Sorrento. All other services will run from Frankston to Portsea. </span></p><p><span>In summer, Route 788 will run to a six-week summer timetable during the last two weeks of December and over January. Weekend services will operate with the same frequency as weekdays, meaning visitors and locals will have more options when they choose to travel over summer weekends. </span></p><p>Route 788 is part of the Night Network. On Friday and Saturday nights buses will operate all night between Frankston and Sorrento only. Selected Night Network services departing Frankston Station will wait up to 20 minutes after the scheduled departure time if the connecting train arriving from the city is running late.</p><p><span>To plan your journey, view the new timetables for <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/982/frankston-portsea-via-dromana-and-rosebud-and-sorrento/">Route 788</a>, visit <a href="https://ptv.vic.gov.au/journey/">Journey planner</a> or call <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/">1800 800 007</a> to order a printed copy of your timetable.</span></p>
