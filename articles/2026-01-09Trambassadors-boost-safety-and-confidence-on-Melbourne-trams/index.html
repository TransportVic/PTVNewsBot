      <h1>Trambassadors boost safety and confidence on Melbourne trams</h1>
      <div><p>The launch of Trambassadors – a Yarra Trams initiative designed to make late-night travel feel safer and more comfortable for everyone.</p><p>Beginning 9 January 2026, teams of three Trambassadors will operate across routes <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/news-and-resources/campaigns/trambassadors">12, 19, 57, 86, 96 and 109</a>. Their focus is simple: provide a friendly, highly trained presence to deter antisocial behaviour and support passengers who may feel unsafe or need assistance.</p><p>The program was co-designed with frontline tram employees and behavioural science experts from The Behavioural Architects. Research conducted during development found that passengers feel 17% safer when visible, approachable staff are present onboard. This insight directly shaped the Trambassadors model, which includes teams of mixed-gender Authorised Officers trained in de-escalation techniques, compassionate engagement, and trauma-informed practices.</p><p>Yarra Trams says the initiative underscores its ongoing commitment to a safe and welcoming tram network, particularly at night when confidence can be lower.</p><p>Passengers will be able to identify the teams by their distinct green and navy uniforms, as well as a new Trambassador icon appearing in TramTracker and at selected stops.</p><p>Trambassadors can assist with wayfinding information, reassurance, or when someone feels uncomfortable or unsafe. Travellers are encouraged to approach them at any time during their journey.</p><p>The program commences on 9 January 2026, providing a visible boost in onboard support during Melbourne’s busiest weekend travel periods.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/news-and-resources/campaigns/trambassadors">Where to find Trambassadors</a> for service information. </p></div>
