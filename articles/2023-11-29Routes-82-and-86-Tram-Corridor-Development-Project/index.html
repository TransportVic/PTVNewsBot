      <h1>Routes 82 and 86 Tram Corridor Development Project</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>We’re changing the way we plan tram stop upgrades to support more inclusive and equitable access to tram travel for more passengers.</p><p>This new approach streamlines how we plan, investigate and design tram stop infrastructure by working on multiple stops along a corridor.</p><p>We’re undertaking planning work on these three corridors across Melbourne:</p><ul><li>Route 82 – Footscray and Maribyrnong corridor (from Footscray Station, along Droop Street to Gordon Street/River Street in Maribyrnong).</li><li>Route 86 – Gertrude Street and Smith Street, Fitzroy and Collingwood corridor (from Nicholson Street/Gertrude Street to Alexandra Parade/Smith Street).</li><li>Route 86 – High Street, Thornbury and Northcote corridor (along High Street from Arthurton Road/Separation Street, Northcote to Blythe Street, Thornbury)</li></ul><p>Tram stop upgrades can change the layout of the street and the way we move around the area. From 31 August to 15 October, we asked for feedback from different community perspectives. We heard from people that lived, shopped locally, worked, visited or travelled through the area. We also heard from people that owned or operated a business or organisation along the corridor.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to provide their feedback.</p><h3>Footscray and Maribyrnong corridor</h3><p>Visit the <a href="https://engage.vic.gov.au/route-82-planning" target="_blank">Engage Victoria website</a> to learn more.</p><h3>Fitzroy and Collingwood corridor and the Thornbury and Northcote corridor</h3><p>Visit the <a href="https://engage.vic.gov.au/route-86-planning" target="_blank">Engage Victoria website</a> to learn more.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>We are currently considering feedback along with network planning priorities, environmental assessments, traffic studies and other project considerations in the development of level access tram stop and street improvement options.</p><p>We will report on what we heard during consultation and next steps in early 2024.</p><p>The Tram Corridor Development Project is in its planning phase and there is currently no funding for tram stop construction.</p><h3>Melbourne’s Tram Plan</h3><p>Melbourne’s Tram Plan outlines how we will deliver a tram network that puts passengers first, connects people to the places they want to go and makes it easier for everyone to catch the tram. It identifies the best way to move forward and ensures Melbourne’s trams continue their critical role in moving locals and tourists alike.</p><p>Visit the Department of Transport and Planning website to <a href="https://dtp.vic.gov.au/trams" target="_blank">learn more about Melbourne's Tram Plan</a>.</p><h3>Get in touch</h3><p>For more information about this project, visit the Engage Victoria website.</p><p>To speak to a customer service team member, <a href="tel:1800800007">call us on 1800 800 007</a>.
