    <p>Following community consultation, the Department of Transport and Planning is making improvements to the Yarra Valley bus network.</p><p>When we consulted the local community, people told us they want a bus network with more direct routes that are better connected to other public transport options to give people more choice of where they want to travel.</p><p>The changes being introduced to the Yarra Valley bus network will see four routes streamlined into two routes, complicated route deviations removed, additional services added, and simplified timetables.</p><p>The changes are designed to streamline the network, expand customer travel choices, and improve productivity and patronage on the network.</p><p>
