      <h1>Very large transport operation on the move - please avoid the area</h1>
      <div><p>The transformer will be transported on an oversized vehicle approximately 65 metres long and 4.2 metres wide.   </p><p>This is a complex operation and for everyone’s safety, stay well clear when the load is in transit and when parked. If you need to travel during the time the transport is on the road, plan ahead or seek an alternate route to avoid delays.    </p><h2>The journey  </h2><p>The transport operation will be guided by a large contingent of escort vehicles and co-pilots travelling in front of and at the rear of the vehicle making sure your roads are safe during and after the move.   </p><p>The transport operation will travel at an average speed of 60km/h. There will be times when travelling over bridges or around corners where they will need to slow to around 5 km/hr.   </p><p>There will be short-term traffic stops on Western Highway at Windemere, Western Highway at Deep Lead, O’Brien’s Road, Corio and Stacey’s Road, Anakie to accommodate the vehicle travelling on the wrong side of the road.  </p><h2>Road safety while the load is in transit  </h2><p>The transport operation will be travelling at significantly reduced speeds.  </p><p>Please plan your journey in advance and allow extra time. There will be opportunities to pass the load under supervision in some locations.  </p><p>If you see the pilot or escort vehicle with an ‘Oversize Load Ahead’ sign and yellow flashing lights, slow down and move as far to the left as you can and prepare to stop if instructed.   </p><p>If you are approaching the transport operation from behind, slow down and be patient as you will be given opportunities to overtake when it is safe.    </p><p>Only overtake when signalled to do so. Do not overtake the pilot or escort vehicle behind the load and get stuck in between. This makes it hard for everyone to do their job safely and you’re putting yourself and others at risk.   </p><p>For more information on safety around an oversized vehicle, please visit the <a href="https://www.nhvr.gov.au/weallneedspace" target="_blank">National Heavy Vehicle Regulator website</a> and click on oversize loads.   </p><h2>Safety when the oversized vehicle and power transformer is parked</h2><p>For your own safety and other road users, please do not stop on the freeway to view the load when it is parked. Stopping on a freeway is illegal and very dangerous for you, passengers in your vehicle and other road users. Penalties may be enforced by Victoria Police and the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator.   </p><p>There will be no viewing opportunities provided. This is for everyone’s safety, including any children accompanying you.  </p><h2>Plan ahead  </h2><p>This is a huge operation with a large crew of specialists involved in the transport, their safety and your safety are the priority.  </p><p>Please plan your journey in advance and avoid the area if possible.  </p><p>Check real time travel advice at the <a href="https://traffic.transport.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank">VicTraffic website</a> and allow plenty of time to get to your destination.  </p></div>
