      <h1>Tram stop upgrade – Stop 4, William Street/Collins Street</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>We’re upgrading Stop 4, William/Collins Street, to create raised side platforms, which will be fully integrated with Melbourne’s expanding fleet of low-floor trams. The upgrade will improve safety and provide level-access boarding for passengers using Route 58. </p><p><strong>Better facilities at Stop 4<br /> <br /> </strong>The upgraded Stop 4 will fully integrate with E-Class and other low-floor trams running on Route 58, allowing everyone to get on and off the tram easily and safely.</p><p>The platforms will feature new shelters, seating, improved lighting, and new audio and visual passenger information displays.</p><p>The upgrade to Stop 4 will also enhance safety by separating passengers from traffic, cyclists and trams with more pedestrian crossing points, new collision barriers and fencing.</p><p><strong>Improved connections for passengers</strong></p><p>Stop 4 is a heavily used stop within the CBD and allows passengers to connect to tram routes 11, 12, 48 and 109.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong>The upgrade will create more accessible interchanges for passengers requiring these other low-floor tram services from nearby Stop 3 on Collins Street. The introduction of E-Class trams on Route 58 will also provide better level-access connectivity to key destinations, including South Yarra Station, Queen Victoria Market and Melbourne Zoo.<br /> <br /> <strong>When will the upgrade happen?</strong></p><p>Major 24-hour works will take place from <strong>Tuesday 1 February to Monday 7 February 2022.</strong> <br /> <br /> During this time Stop 4 will be closed and the section of William Street, between Collins and Bourke streets, will be closed. <br /> <br /> More information about the work will be provided nearer the time.</p>
