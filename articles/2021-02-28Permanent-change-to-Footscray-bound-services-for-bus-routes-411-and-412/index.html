      <p>From Sunday 28 February 2021, the temporary changes to Footscray bound services on routes 411 and 412 will become permanent. Services will travel via Princes Highway Service Road between Geelong Street and Sunshine Road.</p><p>The change will become permanent to avoid buses having to perform a right-hand turn at the unsignalised Geelong Street/Sunshine Road intersection. Using the signalised Princes Highway Service Road intersection to connect with Sunshine Road will improve safety for passengers and all road users.</p><p>Passengers connecting with train services at West Footscray Station should continue using the stop on Princes Highway Service Road near Sunshine Road.</p><p>Services travelling to Laverton remain unaffected.</p><p>View the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402233145/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/15025/411-laverton-station-footscray-via-altona-meadows-and-altona-and-millers-rd/">Route 411</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402233145/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/15026/412-laverton-station-footscray-via-altona-meadows-and-altona-and-mills-st/">Route 412</a> timetables.</p><p>To plan your journey, visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402233145/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/journey/">Journey planner</a> or order a printed copy of a timetable by calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210402233145/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/">1800 800 007</a>.</p>
