      <h1>Investigation works on Midland Highway at Creswick</h1>
      <div><p>To allow crews to safely complete these works, the highway will be closed in both directions between Bungaree-Creswick Road (Melbourne Road) and the Western Freeway from November 12-16, 2025.</p><p>The closure will be in place to allow crews to carry out in-depth assessments on the condition of this section of highway due to ongoing structural issues and investigate a permanent solution that may be required to protect the longevity of the road.  </p><p>Detours will be in place for the duration of the works. Drivers travelling in both directions should use Ballarat-Daylesford Road and Bungaree-Creswick Road to safely reach their destination.  </p><p>Temporary signage and traffic controllers will be on-site to guide traffic through the area.  </p><p>We ask that all road users take extra care when travelling along detour routes, observe traffic management signs and drive to the posted speed limit.</p><p><strong>Please note: These dates and times are subject to change due to weather conditions. </strong></p></div>
