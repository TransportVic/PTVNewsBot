      <p>We are aware of a planned industrial action impacting bus services operated by CDC and Dysons on Thursday 12 June.</p><p>This has the potential to affect a significant number of routes across Melbourne, as well as bus services in Geelong, Mildura and Ballarat. </p><p>We will look to minimise impacts to passengers as much as possible. More information will be available over the coming days. Please visit the PTV website for regular updates closer to the date. </p><p>We encourage all parties involved to negotiate and achieve a resolution.</p>
