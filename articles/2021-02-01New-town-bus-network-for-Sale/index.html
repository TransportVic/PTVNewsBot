In some places traffic will merge right around stopping buses.</li><li>Be sure to slow down, give way and be patient while buses are slowing and stopping.</li><li>And if you’re a pedestrian, take care when crossing the road, even when using signalled pedestrian crossings.</li></ul><p><strong>Avoid parking in bus zones</strong> - from Monday 1 February, all of Sale’s new bus stops will display bus stop flags, which will mean that they are active bus zones, and that it is illegal to park within them.</p><p>If you have any questions about the new town bus network services, please contact Littles Gippsland Coaches on 5144 2623 or via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210227041009/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f4919a85819d869d9187b4989d808098918787959891da979b99da9581cb8781969e919780c9b89d9a9fd1c6c4809bd1c6c49199959d98d1c6c4919a85819d869d9187d1c0c4989d808098918787959891da979b99da9581"><span>[email protected]</span></a></p>
