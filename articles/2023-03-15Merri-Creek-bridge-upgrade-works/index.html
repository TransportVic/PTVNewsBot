      <h1>Merri Creek bridge upgrade works</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>From 12am Sunday 28 November to 5am Monday 6 December, High Street between Westgarth Street and Hoddle Street in Northcote will be closed for essential bridge upgrade and tram track renewal works.</p><h2>About the project</h2><p>The Victorian Government is investing $1.3 million to upgrade the bridge over the Merri Creek on High Street in Northcote. </p><p>To be able to complete this work safely, we’ll be closing a section of High Street between Westgarth Street and Hoddle Street in Northcote from 12am Sunday 28 November until 5am Monday 6 December. </p><p>As part of this upgrade, we will: </p><ul><li>Demolish the existing pavement and tram track slab</li><li>Replace the existing clay fill-in with cement stabilised material</li><li>Construct a new tram track slab and install new tram tracks</li><li>Reinstate the existing road conditions at the completion of works</li></ul><p>Medium to high level noise can be expected in the first 1-3 days of works while we demolish the existing bridge deck. However, there will be intermittent noise expected after this time.</p><p>Where possible, we’ll look to complete significantly noisy works during the day to accommodate for local residents. </p><p>Traffic management will be on site and detours will be in place to help motorists travel around the works safely. </p><p>Access for local residents and businesses will be maintained at all times during construction. Pedestrians and cyclists will also be able to travel through the work zone including being able to access the Merri Creek trail. </p><h2>Project background</h2><p>This work is being completed as part of the Securing the Safety and Productivity of Victoria’s Road Network program.</p><p>Bridge upgrade works are being delivered throughout metropolitan Melbourne to ensure all tram classes and heavy vehicles are being catered for across our ever-changing transport network. The bridge over the Merri Creek is more than 100 years old. </p><p>To ensure its structural integrity for the next 100 years, we’re replacing the existing bridge deck with a cement stabilised deck and renewing the tram tracks on the bridge. </p><h2>Public transport changes  </h2><h3>Bus impacts</h3><p>During works, there will be changes for the 250/251 buses. Bus stops along Westgarth Street, High Street and the Clifton Hill interchange will not be serviced between Sunday 28 November and Monday 6 December. </p><p>Passengers will instead be required to use the bus stops on Victoria Road or the temporary bus stops provided on Rushall Crescent as an alternative. </p><p>Buses will be detouring around the work zone, using Jeffrey Street, Heidelberg Road and Queens Parade to travel between Victoria Road and Rushall Crescent. </p><p>For more information on service changes during the works, visit bus Routes 250 and 251 disruption<a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/routes-250-and-251-temporary-stop-closures-from-saturday-27-november-to-monday-6-december-2021"></a>.</p><h3>Tram impacts</h3><p>Buses will replace trams between the Clifton Hill interchange and Dundas Street from first service Sunday 28 November until the last service on Sunday 5 December.</p><p>Trams will resume running on route 86 from the first service on Monday 6 December.</p><p>Temporary bus stops will be provided at each tram stop, except for stop 26 - Walker Street. </p><p>Tram replacement buses run to normal frequency during works, however there may be some delays due to congestion around the works zone. </p><p>For more information on service changes during the works, visit Route 86 tram disruption.<a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/route-86-buses-replace-trams-from-sunday-28-november-to-sunday-5-december-2021" target="_blank"></a></p><div> <span> <strong><a href="/files/bfa10288fb32d1c35d08e58013f9561f0bba592b.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PTV-default-site/footer/about-ptv/improvements-and-projects/tram/High-St-works-map.png" alt="Hight St works map" width="600" height="628" loading="lazy" /></a></strong> <span>(PNG) 241 KB</span> </span><p>Hight St works map</p></div><h2>Local businesses</h2><p>While we complete these important bridge strengthening works, it’s business as usual for your local traders.
