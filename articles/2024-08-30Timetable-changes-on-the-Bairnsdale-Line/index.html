      <p>From Sunday, 15 September 2024, there will be a new train timetable for the Bairnsdale Line, including more VLocity trains and additional stops.</p><p>Every day, the first train to Bairnsdale and the last train to Melbourne will be replaced with VLocity trains. This change means VLocity trains will run on all Bairnsdale Line services.</p><p>These services will make additional stops at Trafalgar, Yarragon, Longwarry, Bunyip, Nar Nar Goon, Tynong and Clayton, giving passengers more travel options with no increase in travel time.</p><p>The VLocity trains that operate on the Bairnsdale Line will not have on-board café and bar facilities.
