    <p>From Monday 21 February 2022, we’re introducing the new on-demand bus service FlexiRide to the Mornington Peninsula and making changes to Route 787 and Route 886. These changes will give residents in Safety Beach, Dromana, McRae and Rosebud a faster and more convenient way to travel.</p><h3>FlexiRide Rosebud</h3><p>FlexiRide is a 12-month trial and will replace bus Route 787 between Safety Beach and Rosebud, as well as Route 886.</p><p>FlexiRide has no fixed route and only operates when booked. Passengers can book a trip from their nearest physical or virtual bus stop and travel to and from the designated FlexiRide bus hubs within the same service area. FlexiRide Rosebud bus hubs are located at Dromana Hub Shopping Centre, Rosebud Plaza, Rosebud Hospital and Rosebud Village Shopping Centre.</p><div>
