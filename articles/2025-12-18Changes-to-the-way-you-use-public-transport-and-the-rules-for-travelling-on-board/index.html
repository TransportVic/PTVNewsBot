      <h1>Changes to the way you use public transport and the rules for travelling on board</h1>
      <div><p>The updated Conduct on Public Transport Regulations 2025 include new restrictions on the carriage of converted e-bikes as well as new rules related to the use of other ridable e-devices. These includes:</p><ul><li>Converted e-bikes are banned on metropolitan and V/Line trains and within ticketed areas. The penalty for breaching the rule is $508.78 for adults or $101.76 for children.</li><li>E-bikes, e-scooters and other rideable e-devices must be switched off and cannot be ridden or charged on board, on platforms or in station precincts. The penalty is $508.78 for adults or $101.76 for children.</li><li>Only foldable e-scooters and e-bikes are allowed on trams and PTV buses. </li></ul><p>These changes are aimed at keeping passengers and staff safe from the fire risks associated with some lithium-ion batteries, as well as providing accessibility and comfort for passengers. The changes do not apply to Mobility scooters, which will continue to be allowed on the network. </p><p>Find out more, including a fact sheet with examples of <a href="https://transport.vic.gov.au/plan-a-journey/public-transport-tools-and-resources/travel-tips-and-resources/bringing-items-on-public-transport/bicycles-and-public-transport">converted e-bikes here</a>.</p><p>We’re also making changes to regulations around behaviour on public transport to keep our network safe, clean and enjoyable for all passengers.</p><p>The changes include:</p><ul><li>Small kids’ bikes with a maximum wheel diameter of 31cm can now be carried on buses and trams.  Balance bikes or kids’ tricycles (without a chain), which are considered ‘wheeled toys’ continue to be allowed on all forms of public transport.</li><li>Passengers must vacate a wheelchair priority area if a wheelchair user needs it, without being asked. This will make sure people with accessibility needs can access priority areas comfortably. The penalty for breaching the rule will be $305.27 for adults and $101.76 for children.</li><li>A new general ‘soiling of furniture’ rule which replaces the previous ‘no feet on seats’ rule.  The penalty for breaching the rule will be $254.39 for adults and $101.76 for children – which is the same as the current penalty.</li></ul><p>The changes come after Victorians were invited to give feedback on a range of proposals – find out more at <a href="https://engage.vic.gov.au/public-transport-regulations" target="_blank">EngageVictoria</a>.</p><p>The rules commence on 21 December 2025 and the Department of Transport and Planning is working with operators on these changes, as they are introduced.</p></div>
