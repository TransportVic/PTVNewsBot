      <h1>Improving connectivity at Merinda Park Station</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>We’ve improved accessibility for public transport users at Merinda Park Station with a new bus interchange, upgraded commuter car parking and pedestrian access improvements.  </p><p>The upgraded carparks are now open, and the bus interchange will formally become operational from 16 June.</p><p>From Sunday 16 June 2024, Routes 863 <em>Endeavour Hills SC to Cranbourne West via Hallam Rd</em> and 881 <em>Merinda Park Station to Clyde North</em> will have minor route and timetable changes to coincide with services starting to use the new interchange.</p><h3>What works have been done at Merinda Park Station?</h3><p>We’ve built a new three-bay bus interchange, with shelters and information displays to make transfers more comfortable and easier.</p><p>More than 100 new and upgraded car parking spaces have been added to help commuters get to the station.</p><p>Other safety improvements include CCTV and lighting upgrades, a new zebra crossing in the eastern carpark, as well as footpath upgrades, new fencing, tactile ground surfaces and signage.</p><h3>Why did we upgrade Merinda Park Station?</h3><p>Melbourne is growing and we’re adding more capacity to our transport network to provide more services and reliability for passengers.</p><p>The recent upgrades at Merinda Park Station ensure critical transport infrastructure meets Victoria’s future operational needs and increased demands on the network.</p><p>Merinda Park Station previously had limited public transport access. The platform from the city connects to the Route 799 bus, which stopped near the station.</p><p>The platform to the city connected to the Route 881 bus, however, the closest stop was 500 metres from the station and required commuters to cross six lanes on Thompsons Road.</p><p>This is a significant barrier for some commuters, particularly those with mobility issues. Additionally, there was pedestrian access safety issues through the previous informal car park.</p><p>These upgrades now give public transport users better connections between their train and local bus services and encourage the use of more sustainable transport modes to and from the station.</p><p>This project is supported by the Growth Areas Infrastructure Contribution Fund, which supports the delivery of State and regionally significant infrastructure projects in Melbourne’s growing communities.</p><p><img src="/files/dca83b71b6a2b124c0ae8de31a8c25d127bf60a7.png" alt="A map of Merinda Park Station, indicating locations of the new bus interchange and new commuter carpark." width="600" height="521" loading="lazy" /></p><h3>Find out more:</h3><p>Call our Customer Service Centre on 1800 800 007 or email us at <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7b0b0f0d0b0914111e180f083b0f091a15080b14090f550d1218551c140d551a0e"><span>[email protected]</span></a>.</p>
