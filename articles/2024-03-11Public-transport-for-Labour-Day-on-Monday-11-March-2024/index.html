    <p>The Labour Day public holiday falls on Monday 11 March 2024. Public transport services will mostly run to a Saturday timetable, but some services may be altered or will not run.</p>
<p>During public holidays, your daily myki fare is capped at $7.20 ($3.60 for concessions and seniors). You can enjoy all-day unlimited travel.</p>
<p>While some concession holders may benefit from free travel on weekends, please note this entitlement does not extend to public holiday weekend timetables. During public holidays, normal myki fare caps apply to all passengers, including seniors.</p>
