The substations contain electrical equipment that is connected to nearby power lines. Without substations, the tram network can’t operate. \nHow do they work?\nTram substations contain a transformer that converts high-voltage electricity from the local power network into the lower voltage needed to run trams.  \nThey do not generate power like a power station, only convert the power from AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current) so it can be used by trams.  \nPower from the substation to the tram line is connected via cables to the track overhead wires. \n\n\t\n    How is the location chosen for a tram substation?\nWe model the network’s power demands now and into the future to identify where a tram substation is needed. \nSeveral factors are considered when selecting a substation site, including proximity to a connection point for local power. \nThere is often only one suitable and viable location for a substation. \nSubstation safety\nTram substations are located throughout Melbourne and have been for decades. \nThey meet international safety guidelines and operate with minimal impact on the local community.\nElectromagnetic emissions or electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are present naturally in the environment through phenomena like the earth’s magnetic field and thunderstorms. \nAnywhere there is electricity, there are EMFs  – including powerlines that bring electricity to homes, mobile phones, computers, toasters and hair dryers. \nThe Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) follows international guidelines that ensure EMFs are at acceptable levels. \nFor substations and transformers, the magnetic fields at distances of 5-10 metres away are generally indistinguishable from typical background levels in the home.  \nTram power substations developed by the Department of Transport and Planning generate a field of about 2 μT, well below the exposure limit in the international guidelines of 200 μT. \nThere’s a range of magnetic field levels in and around Australian homes. \n\n\t\n    How is the location chosen for a tram substation?\nWe model the network’s power demands now and into the future to identify where a tram substation is needed. \nSeveral factors are considered when selecting a substation site, including proximity to a connection point for local power. \nThere is often only one suitable and viable location for a substation. \nSubstation safety\nTram substations are located throughout Melbourne and have been for decades. \nThey meet international safety guidelines and operate with minimal impact on the local community.\nElectromagnetic emissions or electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are present naturally in the environment through phenomena like the earth’s magnetic field and thunderstorms. \nAnywhere there is electricity, there are EMFs  – including powerlines that bring electricity to homes, mobile phones, computers, toasters and hair dryers. \nThe Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) follows international guidelines that ensure EMFs are at acceptable levels. \nFor substations and transformers, the magnetic fields at distances of 5-10 metres away are generally indistinguishable from typical background levels in the home.  \nTram power substations developed by the Department of Transport and Planning generate a field of about 2 μT, well below the exposure limit in the international guidelines of 200 μT. \nThere’s a range of magnetic field levels in and around Australian homes.","articleDescription":"Tram substations are located throughout Melbourne to keep our trams running.
