Additional stops would be installed along Springs Road between Bourke and Bunney roads.</p><p>Most residents who use these stops would remain within 400 metres of a bus service while other residents would be within 800 metres of a bus service.</p><p>We are also proposing to remove Route 821 <em>Southland – Clayton via Heatherton</em> to reduce duplication with Route 631 and simplify travel options for passengers.</p><p>The following map shows the proposed changes to routes 631 and 821.</p><p><img src=\"DOT0172-Heatherton-Route-631_WEB_FA.png\" alt=\"Map of proposed changes to bus routes 631 and 821\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1566\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p><p> <span> <strong><a href=\"DOT0172-Heatherton-Route-631_WEB_FA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download a larger version of the map.</a></strong> <span>(PDF) 57 KB</span> </span></p><p>Please let us know how these proposed changes may affect you by emailing <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80e3efededf5eee9f4f9c0f4f2e1eef3f0eff2f4aef6e9e3aee7eff6aee1f5bff3f5e2eae5e3f4bdc2f5f3a5b2b0f2eff5f4e5f3a5b2b0b6b3b1a5b2b0e1eee4a5b2b0b8b2b1\"><span>[email protected]</span></a> or by calling <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/customer-service/public-transport-call-centre/\">1800 800 007</a> by Friday 17 March 2023.</p>","articleDescription":"We’re proposing changes to bus routes 631 and 821.","pdfLinks":["https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/default-site/footer/about-ptv/improvements-and-projects/bus-and-coach/DOT0172-Heatherton-Route-631_WEB_FA.pdf"],"imgLinks":["https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/default-site/footer/about-ptv/improvements-and-projects/bus-and-coach/DOT0172-Heatherton-Route-631_WEB_FA.png"],"category":[]}
